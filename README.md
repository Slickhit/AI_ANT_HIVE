# AI Ant Hive

AI Ant Hive is a small Tkinter based simulation of an ant colony. Worker ants gather food and feed it to their queen while scout ants wander the area. A simple dashboard displays how much food has been collected, how much has been fed to the queen and how many ants are currently active.

<!-- Optionally include a screenshot or GIF demonstrating the ants moving and feeding the queen. -->
