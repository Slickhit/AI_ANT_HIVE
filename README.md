# AI Ant Hive

AI Ant Hive is a small Tkinter based simulation of an ant colony. Worker ants gather food and feed it to their queen while scout ants wander the area. A simple dashboard displays how much food has been collected, how much has been fed to the queen and how many ants are currently active.

<!-- Optionally include a screenshot or GIF demonstrating the ants moving and feeding the queen. -->

## Running the simulation

1. Install **Python 3.11** or newer.
2. Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Start the GUI using `python ant_sim.py`.

## Development

The project includes a small test suite located in the `tests` folder.
Run it using `pytest` to ensure everything works as expected.
