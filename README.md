# AI Ant Hive

AI Ant Hive is a small Tkinter based simulation of an ant colony. Worker ants gather
food and deliver it to their queen while scouts explore the surroundings. The GUI
displays how much food has been collected, how much has been fed to the queen and
the number of active ants.

<!-- Optionally include a screenshot or GIF demonstrating the ants moving and feeding the queen. -->
